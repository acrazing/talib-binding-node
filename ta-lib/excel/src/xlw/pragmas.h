\file pragmas.h
\brief Pragmas directives are to be included before any header.

There is not much about this file, it mainly deactives the warning C4251,
C4275 and C4786. The later also guards against a bug in MSVC 6.0 that
causes C4786 to reappear even though you already deactivated it. see
http://www.deja.com for more information about C4786.
