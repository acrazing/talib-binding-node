  When we pass XLOPER from the XLL towards Excel we should not use 
  XLL local variables as it would be freed before MSExcel could get 
  the data.

  Therefore the framework C library that comes with \ref XLSDK97 "Excel 
  97 developer's kit" suggests to use a static area where the XlfOper
  are stored (see XlfExcel::GetMemory) and still available to
  Excel when we exit the XLL routine. This array is then reset
  by a call to XlfExcel::FreeMemory at the begining of each new
  call of one of the XLL functions.
